<h3>
    Courses in Game Programming will emphasize the essential issues and the skills required to develop games for multiple video
game platforms such as PC, console, mobile, online and virtual reality. These skills have broader applications in related
industries such as entertainment, business, research and training. Game Programming students begin with the programming
principles, skills and techniques shared in all programming disciplines, and then focus on game-specific features and
techniques. This degree emphasizes C++ programming, C# programming, scripting, data handling, gameplay interaction,
artificial intelligence, networking and the use of industry-standard middleware, game engines, and APIs. Students in the
Game Programming major will also develop a critical approach to the study of gameplay, interaction and design.
